this task really helps me to improve my typing skills, it is going to be really time saving, and we can achieve the 
skill to learn fast and do our project faster, also typing is a very important skill in coding i think. 
the main thing is perception, if we type fast when we are sitting in an interview's coding round, that time it will be
really helpful to get interviewers impression. 
we will look like a pro coder. and also it is not going to be boring if we type like this. we can fix our problem 
more faster, some of my friends who do not have typing skills and they argue that it is not very important, have this 
problem when they are getting some error most probably some syntax problems, may be just overwriting 10 lines can 
solve the problem, but they are lazy because it takes too much of time. 
so overall typing is really important skills, and i enjoy the tasks.
