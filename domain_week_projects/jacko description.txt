jacko willing is a wonderful personality. there is something to learn in every words he talks. the topic of the 
interview was about dicipline and freedom. normal people cannot find what is the relationship between dicipline and
freedom. everyone thinks that dicipline will destroy freedom. but jacko willing convey us with his powerful 
thoughts that if you want to be free, there should be a dicipline. if you want to get financial freedom you really want
to practice financial dicipline. that was the best part i felt in this interview.

also he talks about his experiences and about scheduling time and all, every one will schedule a routine for the
entire day. but he says not to do so. because you cannot make it, and he suggest to schedule only 4 hours , within 
this 4 hours we have to complete all our very important tasks, after that we can be little bit relaxed, and go for 
surfing and all. 

it was really striking, thoughtfull and i would like to implement the principle he taugt us.
