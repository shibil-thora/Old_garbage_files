* I have learned so-much of things during these shorter period of time , 
* Atmosphere of brocamp Helped me a Lot
* my self-Learning improved 
* dicipline and communication skills are also being improved.
* it interesting to build new Habits , it is easy when we are here in the brocamp
* Like kochi and calicut we need 14hour time to work out , that is the only draw back i have noticed
